If you run these functions inside of a jupyter notebook, useful matplotlib settings include:

plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 100  #quality of images, larger values takes longer to plot
plt.rcParams['image.origin'] = 'lower'  # we want to show images, not matrices, so we set the origin to the lower-left
plt.matplotlib.style.use('dark_background')  # Optional configuration: if run, this will look nice on dark background notebooks

*** Also, before using any function as shown below, please import your fits images and assign them to variables as below: ***
    
    # image = fits.getdata(path-to-fits-file)

*** where path-to-fits-file should be replaced with the path on your machine to the image surrounded by quotations ***
