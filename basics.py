If you run these functions inside of a jupyter notebook, useful matplotlib settings include:

plt.rcParams['image.origin'] = 'lower'  # we want to show images, not matrices, so we set the origin to the lower-left
plt.matplotlib.style.use('dark_background')  # Optional configuration: if run, this will look nice on dark background notebooks

*** Also, before using any function as shown below, please import your fits images and assign them to variables as below: ***
